# Maternal Edge-AI Monitoring System

This repository contains early-stage development work for an Edge-AI enabled wearable system focused on maternal health monitoring.

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore non-invasive physiological sensing and lightweight machine learning models deployed on STM32-class microcontrollers to enable early risk detection in maternal health, especially in resource-constrained settings.

## Current Status
- Dataset exploration and preprocessing (PPG, maternal health risk data)
- Early ML model prototyping for risk classification
- System architecture and Edge-AI feasibility analysis

## Datasets
This project uses publicly available, open-access datasets (e.g., Zenodo, UCI) for research and validation purposes.  
Raw datasets are **not hosted** in this repository.

##TEAM STRUCTURE
